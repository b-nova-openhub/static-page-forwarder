gostapafor is a `tool` that allows `content maintainers` to
do `expose and forward html pages to a set of other services`.

More specifically, gostapafor is microservice written in Go that forwards html pages over a RESTful interface. It is
operates on the principles of KISS and is best integrated in a JAMstack.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
<!--- These are just example requirements. Add, duplicate or remove as required --->

* You have installed the latest version of `go1.16.5`
* You have a `Linux/Mac OS` machine with working knowledge of the underlying filesystem and Go build process.

## Installing gostapafor

If you want to try out on your local machine, you can simply install gostapafor system-wide with the following command:

```
$ ‚ùØ  go install -v ./...
```

Alternatively, you can build a binary and run that one with a configurable shell script. See how to **build stapagen
with the Makefile** further down below (#Makefile).

## Running gostapafor

To run gostapafor, follow these steps:

```
$ ‚ùØ  stapafor
```

If you have build stapagen with the Makefile, you can simply adjust the parameters in the shell script `stapagen.sh` and
then launch the script.

```
$ ‚ùØ  ./stapafor.sh
```

This method is preferable as you're more flexible and don't have to retype the binary arguments everytime.

## Reading gostapafor's API

Once gostapafor is running, it does clone the git repository, converts its markdown files to html pages and forwards
them over a RESTful api. That api can be accessed over locally if the executable was run on your local
machine (`http://localhost:8080`) or over a K8s service definition.

## Makefile

There is a Makefile which automates the building process of the stapagen application. The Makefile has 6 build targets:
test, vet, fmt, mod, build, run, install and all. It can simply be run as such:

```
$ ‚ùØ  make build
```

## Dockerfile

There is also a Dockerfile by which one can containerize the stapagen application. The port that is being exposed is the
default 8080.

## Deployment to K8s
